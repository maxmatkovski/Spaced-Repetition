## Introduction

This platform provides a real-time comparison between two prominent spaced repetition algorithms: SM2 and FSRS. Users can test both algorithms simultaneously, track performance metrics, and understand which approach better suits their learning style.

## History of Spaced Repetition

### Origins
- **1885**: Hermann Ebbinghaus discovers the "forgetting curve" and "spacing effect"
- **1932**: Cecil Alec Mace conducts first empirical studies on spaced repetition
- **1967**: Sebastian Leitner develops the "Leitner system" for flashcards
- **1985**: Piotr Wo≈∫niak creates SuperMemo and the SM2 algorithm
- **2022**: Open-source FSRS algorithm is developed as a modern alternative

### Evolution of Algorithms

#### Early Methods
- Manual spacing systems (Leitner boxes)
- Fixed interval repetition
- Gradual refinement through empirical testing

#### Modern Developments
- Computer-assisted scheduling
- Machine learning optimization
- Personalized interval adjustments
- Neural network integration
